# cs465-fullstack

## Architecture

- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  - In this project, we used JavaScript in conjunction with Express HTML to create a dynamic, responsive, multi-paged frontend for our customer. Using Express we were able to add routing logic that could be used to add middleware to routes when necessary. This was especially useful when adding authentication. We also created a single-page application for the administrative page using Angular. This approach is more responsive than a multi-paged frontend since we do not need to make as many requests to the server. Additionally, the SPA uses TypeScript rather than JavaScript which is often seen as better for web development.
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  - MongoDB stores documents in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Since JavaScript is used as the backbone of our frontend, MongoDB naturally works well for communicating data with the frontend.

## Functionality

- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

## Testing

- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
